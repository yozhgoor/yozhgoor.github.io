//! I'm a Former emergency response driver, who always had a big interest in
//! programming and technology. I've been running Linux for 6 years, I tried
//! many distributions (Ubuntu, Tails, Manjaro,...). I use Arch Linux as my
//! daily driver because Arch gives me the opportunity to really discover what
//! it's going on under the hood.
//!
//! I had the chance to get insight knowledge on Rust in 2020 from a friend that
//! became my mentor. I've got the opportunity to learn Rust at RustMinded
//! including all the technical and non-technical skills to become a developer.
//!
//! You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/yozhgoor) and
//! [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yozhgoor).
//! You can also send me an
//! [email](mailto:yohan.boogaert+recruit@protonmail.com).
